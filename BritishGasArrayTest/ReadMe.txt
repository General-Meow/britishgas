3. Tools I

Describe your favourite features of the IDE that you use. How do they make you more productive?
Please avoid obvious things like syntax highlighting and autocompletion.


Intellij Idea. Its just so much nicer :)

One of the things I like most out of idea is that things are in places that make sense. I can find things easier unlike eclipse.
I also like the ability to navigate around the panes and classes with just the keyboard and not use the mouse.

Its really hard answering this question. I'm even writing my answer in idea. It just gets things done right!



4. Tools II

Describe why you hate Maven. Have you used any alternatives? If so, how are they better?

Maven = XML hell. Do you remember EJB's before version 3? its just like that. Too much ceremony scattered about.

I do like gradle. Its my current build tool of choice. I don't really know groovy though so things do get interesting
when I dig deeper. Its far more lighter and easier to use than maven. Although a bit slow... (the gradle daemon makes things
faster though)

Bezel looks interesting but I haven't had the opportunity to use it.

5. Opinion I

Describe a technology trend which you think had the most impact on the developer community
within the last 2-3 years. How has that impacted you? Are you a proponent or an opponent of this
trend? Please don't write more than 500 characters.

There has been quite a few things off the top of my head. Docker and the technologies around that, frontend MVC frameworks,
functional languages are making a come back (Java 8 functional stuff), automation (ansible, chef, puppet), TDD/TBB mockito/cucumber

frontend mvc and java 8 has had the most impact to me although i do see a trend in the automation space.

MVC because I also like working on frontend development. Its interesting to see libraries and frameworks such as angular, ember and knockout
learn the lessons from the backend development space. Also with Java 8 and the functional type of changes they have made to
the language. Its made me look into languages such as scala, erlang and haskell and wonder whey these languages aren't as
prominent as java


All in all i'm up for learning new stuff but there is the question of whether it should be up to a developer to take these
new technologies and therefore those tasks or whether it is for another type of person or a new role to take on.



6. Opinion II

Is Java ready for the 21st century? In your opinion, what are the main problems with Java and
whether other languages have solved them? Please don't write more than 500 characters.

Java is a good language although it does have its problems.

One thing that has bugged me about Java is 'null'. They have gone around the issue slightly with the new "Optional" type
but that doesn't always fix it (guava introduced it a long time ago too).

Scala fixes null (if i remember correctly) by using the NUll type

Java is also very verbose, its gotten slightly better with lambdas but languages like scala take it to another level.

also java is too slow (that was a joke)
